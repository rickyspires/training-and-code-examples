all this code is taken from various courses that i have been following on various web subjects. 

It includes :

    Home
    PHP
    CSS
    Javascript
    Jquery
    Jquery UI
    Ajax
    Social


WARNING: 

Some of the code might not work.
I am in the process of re-building it. 
I intend to scrap various bits, add new bits and make the site more to date .


you should be able to run it from your local host with no need for any db access.
